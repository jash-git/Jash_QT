Configure a system to automount a Samba share with /etc/fstab

by Vivek Gite on April 25, 2006 P 31 comments

As explained earlier you can use the mount command to mount a remote windows partition or a windows share under Linux.

/etc/fstab file contains static information about the filesystems. The file fstab contains descriptive information about the various file systems. fstab is only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this file.

To mount a Samba share to be mounted when a Linux system comes up after reboot edit the /etc/fstab file and put entry as follows for your Windows/Samba share:
//ntserver/share /mnt/samba smbfs username=username,password=password 0 0

For example, if you want to mount a share called //ntserver/docs then you need to write following entry in /etc/fstab file://ntserver/docs /mnt/samba smbfs username=docsadm,password=D1Y4x9sw 0 0Where,

    * //ntserver/docs: Windows 2003/NT/Samba share namen本更害旄m
    * /mnt/samba: Local mount point (you may need to create this directory first)n本更亥乜
    * smbfs: File system type (samba file system) 本更姒
    * username=docsadm,password=D1Y4x9sw: Share username and passwordb腹KX

Open file /etc/fstab using vi text editor:# vi /etc/fstabAppend line //ntserver/docs /mnt/samba smbfs username=docsadm,password=D1Y4x9sw 0 0, at the end your file should read as follows:

proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/hdb1       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
/dev/hdb2       none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   iso9660 ro,user,noauto  0       0
//ntserver/docs /mnt/samba      smbfs   username=docsadm,password=D1Y4x9sw 0 0

Replace sharename, username and password with your actual parameters.

>There are a wide range of USB devices intended for a wide range of
purposes, and this means that implementation details can vary widely. </P
><P
>A device can be self powered,  bus powered or both. The USB can provide
a power supply up to 500mA for its devices. If there are only bus powered
devices on the bus the maximum power dissipation could be exceeded and
therefore self powered devices exist. They need to have their own power
supply. Devices that support both power types can switch to self powered mode
when attaching an external power supply. </P
><P
>Even the maximum communication speed can differ for particular USB devices.
The USB specification differentiates between low speed and  full speed devices.
Low speed devices (such as mice, keyboards, joysticks etc.) communicate
at 1.5MBit/s and have only limited capabilities. Full speed devices (such
as audio and video systems) can use up to 90% of the 12Mbit/s which is about
10Mbit/s including the protocol overhead. High speed devices (introduced in
USB 2.0) can theoretically get to around 400Mbps, although a lot of other
factors come into play at this speed.</P

>Hubs</A
></H2
><P
>Physically there exist one, two or four USB ports at the rear, front or side panel of a
computer. These ports can be used to attach normal devices or a hub. A
hub is a USB device which extends the number of ports to
connect other USB devices. The maximum number of user devices is reduced
by the number of hubs on the bus (i.e. if you attach 50 hubs, then at most 
77 (=127-50) additional devices can be attached. Hubs are always full speed
(for USB 1.1 compliant hubs) or high speed (for USB 2.0 compliant hubs)
devices . If the hub is self powered, then any device can be attached to it.
However if the hub is bus powered, then only low power (100mA max) devices
can be attached to it. A bus powered hub should not be connected to another
bus powered hub - you should alternate between bus powered and self powered
hubs.</P
><P
>Normally the physical ports of the host controller are handled by a
virtual root hub. This hub is simulated by the host
controllers device driver and helps to unify the bus topology. So every port can
be handled in the same way by the USB subsystem's hub driver.</P

>Data Flow Types</A
></H2
><P
>The communication on the USB is done in two directions and uses four different
transfer types. Data directed from the host to a device is called
downstream or OUT transfer. The other direction is called
upstream or IN transfer. Depending on the device type different
transfer variants are used:

send reliable short data packets. It is used to configure devices and every one
is required to support a minimum set of control commands. The 
standard commands are:

reliable data packets up to the full bus bandwidth. Devices like scanners or
scsi adapters use this transfer type.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

transfers which are polled periodically. If an interrupt transfer was submitted
the host controller driver will automatically repeat this request in a specified
interval (1ms - 127ms).</P

data streams in realtime with guaranteed bus bandwidth but without any
reliability. In general these transfer types are used for audio and video
devices.</P
